   <li>Hi. My name is Nur Arina. I have a <mark> BIG DREAM </mark> My dream is to become a <mark>Government Multimedia Administrator </mark>. A role that combines creative digital design with public service. I aspire to use my skills in multimedia to enhance communication in the public sector, develop meaningful visual content, and contribute to the modernization of government media platforms. This career allows me to merge passion and purpose, serving the community through creative technology. I choose this career is because I used to work on Government Agency called Yayasan Pembangunan Keluarga Darul Tazim at Iskandar Puteri, Johor Bahru after I finished my STPM. I learned so many valuable things during my time there. The people at YPKDT were all incredibly kind and welcoming, which made the experience even better. I also really admired the way government staff work, they were efficient but also had a calm and relaxed approach to their tasks. It gave me a new perspective on how public service can be both productive and balanced.</li>
